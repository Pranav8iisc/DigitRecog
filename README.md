==========

This repository contains the code utilizing neural networks for MNIST handwritten digit data-set classification problem. Main purpose is to test the following:
#1. Studying the effect of hidden layer configuration on classification accuracy.
      #1.1. Consider on 2 pixel/feature space for digit recognition and vary number of hidden layers to see the effect(geometrically) on learn-ability of network.
#2. Comparing classification accuracy for networks with linear and sigmoid(or logistic) activation function.
